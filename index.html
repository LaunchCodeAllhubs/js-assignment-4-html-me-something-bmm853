               <h2>The Sea</h2>
               <p>When my friends and I were first bouncing around the idea of going on a trip to celebrate a year in which we would   all be reaching a milestone birthday, we had no idea we would wind up living out an idyllic dream vacation, fulfilling our mutual desires to act like sea-captains. One of the biggest draws of Portland is that it abuts the Atlantic Ocean, allowing for stunning views and boating activities. You really can't go anywhere without a waterside experience, which created a greatly appreciated relaxing and picturesque tone to the vacation.</p>
               <h3>Whale Watching</h3>
                  <p>In true sea-captain fashion, we went on a quest to find some whales, albeit with decidedly less murderous intentions than the famous Ahab. According to the ship's captain, the water was the calmest it had been all year. It appeared as if the ocean and sky were merging together and created the illusion that the ocean was vast and neverending. We saw a variety of animal life: a shark, harbor porpoises, birds, a leaping bluefin tuna. There was an exciting boat chase to hunt down a far-off whale that, unfortunately, ended without success. In the end, we only saw the back half of a whale from quite a distance. Whales are fickle and illusive creatures.</p>

               <h3>Peak's Island</h3>
                  <p>Another highlight of the trip was ferrying to Peak's Island, where we stopped by their kitschy Umbrella Cover Museum and then hiked through the interior of the island to a World War II battery. My favorite part of Peak's Island, though, was hiking along the shoreline. We climbed onto the many rocky becahes to view waves crashing into the rocks and take in the beautiful scenery.</p>

               <h2>Lighthouses</h2>
               <p>When the initial idea of going to Maine was proposed, I excitedly exclaimed, &quotI wanna see some lighthouses!&quot Everyone else seemed to get on board with this sentiment, because this phrase became the motto of our trip. Thankfully, there are many lighthouses to see. We visited the Portland Head Light, a stunning lighthouse that attracts many tourists but is adjacent to a 90-acre park that allows opportunities to space out and enjoy the gorgeous views. We also got to see several lighthouses from the harbor during our whale watching trip, including one nicknamed &quotThe Bug&quot due to its tiny 26-foot stature and the Ram Island Ledge Light, the newest lighthouse in the area with a build date of 1905.</p>

               <h2>Embracing History</h2>
               <p>When I'm traveling, I like to get to know the history of a city. We were able to go on a walking culinary tour as well as visit several historical sites to get a feel for the background of the area. While we didn't get to see everything, it was interesting to learn about some of Portland's past. The city is full of reminders of years gone by, whether 20 or 200 years ago.</p>
               <h3>Old Port</h3>
                  <p>The cobblestone-lined streets of Old Port are a reminder of the pre-revolutionary history of Portland, Maine. Our tour guide shared some fun tidbits such as the fact that some buildings still have shutters on their windows that originally served to stop the bowsprit of ships from crashing through the glass panes. Suffering two massive fires, the city has managed to rebuild and modernize while maintaining its historic charm. </p>

               <h3>Victoria Mansion</h3>
                  <p>Built as a summer home by a former Mainer who moved to the south to beome a hotelier and investor in the slave trade, Victoria Mansion serves as a reminder that the North was not immune to the influence of slavery and racism. A sweet and knowledgeable docent led us through the mansion and shared some interesting information. For instance, the mansion is not done in the Victorian architectural style but was named after Queen Victoria in an attempt to secure funding for repairs to the home. The family was sent a painting instead.</p>

               <h3>Vintage Shops</h3>
                  <p>There are several fun vintage shops in Portland. One in particular focused on all kinds of items from the 90s such as clothing, games, VHS tapes, and trading cards. One of my friends said it felt like her childhood bedroom. Another, while searching the clothing racks, found the same dress she wore to prom. It really drove home the fact that we were in Portland to celebrate getting older. Thanks, Portland.</p>
