            <p>When my friends and I were first bouncing around the idea of going on a trip to celebrate a year 
            in which we would all be reaching a milestone birthday, we had no idea we would wind up living
            out an idyllic dream vacation, fulfilling our mutual desires to act like sea-captains and 
            experiencing the interesting history of Portland, Maine.</p>
            <section id="sea">
               <h2>The Sea</h2>
               <p>One of the biggest draws of Portland is that it abuts the Atlantic Ocean, allowing for stunning
               views and boating activities.</p>
               <h3>Whale Watching</h3>
                  <p>In true sea-captain fashion, we went on a whale-seeking quest with decidedly less murderous
                  intentions than the famous Ahab. Unfortunately, we only saw the back half of a whale
                  from quite a distance. Whales are fickle and illusive creatures.</p>

               <h3>Peak's Island</h3>
                  <p>Another highlight of the trip was ferrying to Peak's Island where we climbed onto the many 
                  rocky becahes to view waves crashing into the rocks.</p>

            <section id="lighthouses">
               <h2>Lighthouses</h2>
               <p>When the initial idea of going to Maine was proposed, I excitedly exclaimed, &quotI wanna see some
               lighthouses!&quot This became the motto of our trip, and, thankfully, there are many lighthouses 
               to see.</p>
               <h3>Portland Head Light</h3>
                  <p>This stunning lighthouse attracts many tourists but is adjacent to a 90-acre park that
                  allows opportunities to space out and enjoy the gorgeous views.</p>

               <h3>The Bug</h3>
                  <p>The Portland Breakwater Light, known as "The Bug" due to its tiny stature, is only 26 
                  feet tall.</p>

               <h3>Spring Point Ledge Lighthouse</h3>  
                  <p>Jutting into the harbor from its home on a community college campus, visitors can walk out on
                  the breakwater to access the lighthouse and its scenic magic.</p>

                  <p>Built in 1905, Ram Island Ledge Light is the newest lighthouse in the area.</p>

               <h2>Embracing History</h2>
               <p>Portland is full of reminders of years past, whether 20 or 200 years ago.</p>
               <h3>Old Port</h3>
                  <p>The cobblestone-lined streets of Old Port are a reminder of the pre-revolutionary history
                  of Portland, Maine. Some buildings still have shutters on their windows that originally 
                  served to stop the bowsprit of ships from crashing through the glass panes. Suffering two
                  massive fires, the city has managed to rebuild and modernize while maintaining its historic
                  charm. </p>

               <h3>Victoria Mansion</h3>
                  <p>Built as a summer home by a former Mainer who moved to the south to beome a hotelier and 
                  investor in the slave trade, Victoria Mansion serves as a reminder that the North was not 
                  immune to the influence of slavery and racism. The mansion is not done in the Victorian 
                  architectural style but was named after Queen Victoria in an attempt to secure funding for 
                  repairs to the home. The family was sent a painting instead. </p>

               <h3>Vintage Shops</h3>
                  <p>There are several fun vintage shops in Portland. One in particular focused on items from the 
                  90s and one of my friends found the same dress she wore to prom there. It really drove home 
                  the fact that we were in Portland to celebrate getting older. Thanks, Portland.</p>
